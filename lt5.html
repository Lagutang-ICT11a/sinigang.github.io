<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>-Pork-while you can use meatier and leaner parts such as pork shoulder (kasim), I recommend bony cuts such as spare ribs, pork belly with ribs, hocks, knuckles, and tailbone or neck bones for better flavor.</ul>
<br>
<ul>-Tomatoes- use ripe, juicy tomatoes</ul>
<br>
<ul>-Onion-peeled and quartered</ul>
<br>
<ul>-Fish sauce- brings umami flavor; you can swap it with salt if you prefer</ul>
<br>
<ul>-Gabi- adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth</ul>
<br>
<ul>-Radish (labanos)</ul>
<br>
<ul>-Vegetables- the recipe uses sitaw (long beans), eggplant, okra, and bok choy, but feel free to include other local produce available such as kangkong (water spinach) and pechay</ul>
<br>
<ul>-Tamarind- can be fresh pods, paste, or powder mixes</ul>
<br>
<ul>-Banana or finger chili peppers (siling haba)-adds a mild heat; optional and can be omitted</ul></div>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>Rinse pork ribs and drain well.
<br>In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that accumulates on top.
<br>Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onion, and fish sauce. Lower heat and simmer for about 1 to 1 Â½ hours or until meat is tender, adding more water as necessary to maintain about 8 cups.
<br>Add gabi and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes or until tender.
<br>Add chili peppers and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.
<br>Add long beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes.
<br>Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.
<br>
<br>If using packaged tamarind base, add to the pot and stir until completely dissolved.
<br>Season with salt and pepper to taste.
<br>Add bok choy and continue to cook for about 1 minute. Serve hot.
<br>If Using Fresh Tamarind
<br>Wash tamarind and place in a saucepan with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and cook until soft and outer skins begin to burst.
<br>With a fork, mash tamarinds.
<br>In a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl, pour tamarind and liquid. Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid into the strainer once or twice, to fully extract the juice.
<br>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the pot of sinigang.</p>
